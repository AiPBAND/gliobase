Interestingly, the marker of chronic inflammation, IL-6, was positively associated with methylation of MGMT (P = 0.004), RARbeta (P = 0.002), and RASSF1A (P = 0.0081) as well as the total number of methylated genes (P < 0.0001), indicating the important role of IL-6 in maintaining promoter methylation of these genes. VEGF expression correlated positively with MGMT and RARbeta methylation although these relationships were of marginal significance (P = 0.0679 and P = 0.0757). Kaplan-Meier univariate survival analysis indicated an unfavorable survival period in patients with MGMT methylation compared with those without methylation (P = 0.0474)."

On the radiographic analysis, 9 of 18 patients (50%) with tumors overexpressing c-Met demonstrated invasive and multifocal lesions on the initial magnetic resonance images, whereas only 9 of 44 patients (20.5%) with tumors that expressed no or little c-Met demonstrated these features (P=.030).

The association between CD63 and TIMP-1 was investigated using previously obtained TIMP-1 data from our astrocytoma cohort. Cellular co-expression of TIMP-1 and CD63 as well as TIMP-1 and the tumor stem cell-related markers CD133 and Sox2 was investigated with immunofluorescence.

Patients were included if they had enough tissue for MGMT analysis, so this excluded patients who only had a biopsy (consistent with the prior study in younger patients). MGMT analysis was performed by extracting tumor genomic DNA from fixed, paraffin-embedded sections for bisulfite conversion (EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, Zymo Research, Orange, CA). MGMT methylation-specific PCR was performed using PCR primer sets specific for methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences.6 Kaplan Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare median progression free (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) in patients who had methylated (ME) MGMT vs unmethylated (UN) MGMT."

                "Of the 64 patients identified, 37 (57.8%) had ME MGMT and 27 (42.2%) did not (table). These results were slightly higher than the 44.7% of patients who had ME MGMT and the 55.3% who had UN MGMT in the Hegi et al.1 study but similar to a small study in very elderly patients (\u226580) where 13/22 patients (59%) had ME MGMT.2 Potential explanations for this small discrepancy include age-related increase in genomic methylation that includes the MGMT promoter or the reduced ability to retrieve usable DNA from archived paraffin-embedded blocks. Initial treatments for patients in our cohort included chemoradiation (35), radiation alone (16), or chemotherapy alone (3). In ME patients, 24/37 patients received an alkylating agent (temozolomide in 23, BCNU in 1) either as first-line therapy (21) or at recurrence (3). Sixteen of the 27 UN patients received an alkylating agent (all temozolomide): 15 as first-line therapy and 1 at recurrence. A total of 10 patients had no or unknown therapy (6 ME, 4 UN). In patients who received an alkylating agent, mOS in ME patients was 489 days vs 263 days in UN patients (p = 0.0021) and mPFS was 405 days vs 246 days (p = 0.2742) (figure e-1 on the Neurology\u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org). In an analysis including all 64 patients, mPFS in ME patients was 328 days vs 173 days in UN patients (p = 0.0241) and mOS was 345 days in ME patients and 223 days in UN patients (p = 0.0178). A univariate Cox proportional hazards model including all 64 patients showed that MGMT methylation was associated with reduced hazard for progression (hazard ratio [HR] 0.427, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.199, 0.914, p = 0.0283) and death (HR 0.475, 95% CI 0.254, 0.890, p = 0.0283). In a multivariate Cox model including age, extent of resection, Karnofsky performance score, and alkylator use, MGMT methylation was significantly associated with a reduced hazard for progression (HR 0.374, 95% CI 0.138, 1.0, p = 0.0521) and death (HR 0.243, 95% CI 0.097, 0.608, p = 0.0025). These results suggest that MGMT methylation is a positive prognostic biomarker in the elderly GBM patient population independent of treatment received."

                "Since MGMT methylation was previously thought to be a predictive marker associated with improved response to temozolomide, further work will need to be done to clarify if MGMT methylation is also a predictive marker in elderly patients. We were unable to address this question specifically in our study because of the small number of patients not treated with an alkylating agent.  Tumor tissue markers such as MGMT that may influence prognosis or clinical trial design are just as valid in the elderly population as in younger patients. Although our study was retrospective, it is the largest study of MGMT methylation status in this population. MGMT appears to be a useful prognostic marker in elderly GBM patients and its role in guiding treatment choices as a potential predictive biomarker should be explored in prospective studies."

Among four glioblastoma subtypes, ANXA2P1 and ANXA2P2 were preferentially expressed in mesenchymal subtype and less expressed in proneural subtype. Meanwhile, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the expression level of ANXA2 was positively correlated with ANXA2 pseudogenes expression. Then, the expression patterns of ANXA2 and its pseudogenes were validated in diffuse glioma specimens (n=99) and non-tumor tissues (n=12) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that highly expressed ANXA2 and annexin A2 pseudogenes were associated with the poor survival outcome of glioma patients. Cox regression analyses suggested that ANXA2, ANXA2P1 and ANXA2P2 were the independent prognosis factors for gliomas.

Clinical data were derived from contributing center institutional diagnoses at Henry Ford Hospital, UCSF, Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, and NCI and are available as Table S1. Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 CEL files were normalized using the robust multi-array average (RMA) method [10] with default parameters from the Matlab Bioinformatics Toolbox. Of the 296 samples downloaded, 176 had associated survival data, 75 were oligodendrogliomas or astrocytomas with grades II or III, and 101 were GBMs. Copy number data was derived using Affymetrix 100K SNP arrays available from the Rembrandt public data repository. Of the 176 samples with survival data, 147 have associated SNP arrays for tumor tissue (85 GBMs, 34 Oligodendrogliomas grades II and III, and 28 Astrocytomas grades II and III). To classify Rembrandt samples within the TCGA classification schema, Rembrandt data for the probes from the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip were mapped to the TCGA class signature genes using HUGO gene symbol and Entrez gene ID number. Differences in gene expression between subtypes were determined using the comparative selection marker module of GenePattern 3.0. Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were used to examine the association between patient survival and four subtypes after adjusting for patient age at diagnosis as well as 1p/19q status whenever applicable."

This gene expression signature was enriched in tumors with oligodendroglioma histology and also predicted improved survival in this tumor type (n =\u200a 43, p \u200a=\u200a 1.25e-4).

Integrated DNA and RNA analysis of low-grade and high-grade proneural gliomas identified increased expression and gene amplification of several genes including GLIS3, TGFB2, TNC, AURKA, and VEGFA in proneural GBMs, with corresponding loss of DLL3 and HEY2. Pathway analysis highlights the importance of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in the proneural subtype. This demonstrates that the expression signatures identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for low-grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and therapy."

The leptin/ObR system was highly expressed in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, while lower expression of both markers was noted in low-grade astrocytomas and gangliogliomas. The association between leptin/ObR and the degree of tumor malignancy was highly significant (P < 0.001). Using double immunofluorescence of glioblastoma tissues, we found co-expression of leptin with ObR and with the proliferation marker Ki-67 in 87% and 64% of cells, respectively. The leptin/ObR-positive tissues also expressed activated forms of STAT3 and Akt. In line with this finding, ObR-positive glioblastoma cells responded to leptin with cell growth and induction of the STAT3 and Akt pathways as well as inactivation of the cell cycle suppressor Rb."

Ggalectin-1 expression is a poor prognostic factor for patients with GBM treated with adjuvant RT. Studies investigating the targeting of galectin-1 for radioresistance are encouraged in an effort to treat this aggressive brain tumor. The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and limited sample size. According to the national law of human research, informed consent for research should be obtained for work performed in our country after 2002. As we could only include patients before 2002, and the sample size was therefore small. Because these patients were treated a long time ago, almost all were dead, their charts were destroyed, and the time to progression could not be confirmed. Nonetheless, the time to progression and the survival time were correlated in patients who underwent imaging follow-up",

In addition, MGMT promoter methylation is associated with patient response to alkylating agents and OS. Because the proportion of MGMT promoter methylation in the included patients was undetermined, it remains unclear whether galectin-1 expression may affect the importance of the MGMT promoter methylation status for prognosis. Future studies are required to analyze the effect of other factors, such as MGMT methylation promoter status."
