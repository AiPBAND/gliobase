Statistical methods were employed to assess the degree of association between EGFR amplification/overexpression and p53 immunopositivity. Survival analyses were performed by employing Cox proportional hazard models to assess the independent prognostic value of EGFR/p53 alterations and test the propensity for risk with age by assessing their interaction with patient age.	A strong positive correlation between EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression (rho=0.5157; p<0.0001; CI 0.3783 to 0.6309) and a negative association of EGFR amplification (rho=-0.3417; p<0.0001; CI -0.4842 to -0.1816) and EGFR overexpression (rho=-0.3095; p<0.001; CI -0.4561 to -0.1465) with p53 immunopositivity was observed. Only patient age (HR: 1.029; p=0.004; CI 1.009 to 1.049) was associated with shorter survival by univariate Cox regression analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models revealed a statistically significant interaction between EGFR overexpression and age to be associated with shorter survival (HR: 1.001; p<0.0001; CI 1.000 to 1.002), thus predicting a higher hazard with increasing age. No age interaction of EGFR amplification status (HR: 1.001; p=0.642; CI 0.995 to 1.008) and p53 immunopositivity (HR: 1.000; p=0.841; CI 0.999 to 1.001) was noted in this cohort.	The prognostic value of EGFR overexpression is age-dependent, and there is a propensity for a higher hazard with increasing patient age. Identifying such groups of patients with more aggressive disease becomes mandatory, since they would benefit from intense therapeutic protocols targeting EGFR.

In addition, we examined methylation status of MGMT promoter by methylation-specific real-time PCR, as this has been shown to be a predictive marker in glioblastomas.	MGMT methylation status was not correlated with response to concomitant chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide (RT/TMZ). MiR-221 (p=0.016), miR-222 (p=0.038), miR-181b (p=0.036), miR-181c (p=0.043) and miR-128a (p=0.001) were significantly down-regulated in glioblastomas. The most significant change was observed for up-regulation in miR-21 expression in glioblastomas (p<0.001). MiR-181b and miR-181c were significantly down-regulated in patients who responded to RT/TMZ (p=0.016; p=0.047, respectively) in comparison to patients with progredient disease.

These measurements identified three patients categories (categories 1-3), displaying significant differences in telomere numbers/nucleus (P(1) = .0275; P(2) <or= .0001), telomere length (P(1) and P(2) = .0275), and number of telomeric aggregates (P(1) = .0464; P(2) <or= .0001).	These categories corresponded to patients with long-term, intermediate, and short-term survival, respectively (P = .0393). The time to progression analyses showed significant differences between the three categories (P = .0167). There was a correlation between time to progression, median survival, and nuclear telomere architecture.	Our study suggests a link between patient outcome and three-dimensional nuclear-telomere organization and highlights the potential clinical power of telomere signatures as a new prognostic, predictive, and potentially pharmacodynamic biomarker in GBM. Furthermore, novel automated three-dimensional high-throughput scanning as developed here permits to obtain data from 300 nuclei in 20 minutes.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to determine the type and histological grade according to WHO (2007) classification of CNS tumors. Immunostaining was done using anti p53 and CD31 and the results were measured as labeling index (LI) using image analyzer system CAS-200.	Both p53 and CD31 expressions were correlated well with the histopathological grades of different subtypes of astrogliomas with good discrimination between low and high grades. Overall, a highly significant statistical correlation was observed between the grades of astrocytomas and the p53 and CD31 labeling indices. The expressions of p53 and CD31 were markedly increased in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with mean values (59.7 +/- 13.5) (P = 0.0001) and (40.7 +/- 8.9) (P = 0.001), respectively. Obviously, these observations demonstrate that the co-expression and increased levels of p53 and CD31 in astrogliomas are increasing as the tumor grade is increasing.	The estimation of p53 and CD31 could be used as good tools to assess the grade, prognosis, and aggressiveness of the astroglial tumors. Thus, the two markers can be used as adjunct to the diagnosis and stratification of the high grade from the low-grade intrinsic brain astrogliomas.

The protein expression of CD133 was examined by western blot analysis of tumor specimens, and the CD133 expression levels were quantified by densitometry and normalized to beta-actin.	The results indicated that CD133 expression levels are significantly higher in glioblastomas with dissemination (mean 10.3, range 0.20-27.8) than in those without (mean 1.18, range 0.07-3.58).	The results suggest that CD133 could be a molecular predictor of glioblastoma dissemination, and also give rise to an intriguing idea that CD133-positive cancer stem cells may be implicated in the initiation of disseminated lesions.

Tumor samples from 37 patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial on WT1 immunotherapy were immunohistochemically analyzed for WT1 levels and MIB-1 index.	Results showed that median progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in the WT1 high expression group (score 3 and 4) compared with that of the low expression group (score 1 and 2) (20.0 weeks vs. 8.0 weeks; P = 0.022), and that the median overall survival (OS) was likewise longer in the former compared to the latter group (54.4 weeks vs. 28.4 weeks; P = 0.035). Furthermore, within the WT1 high expression group, tumors with intermediate staining intensity (WT1 score 3) have both the longest median PFS and OS, 24.4 weeks and 69.4 weeks, respectively. On the other hand, no significant correlation was noted between MIB-1 staining index and survival. 	In conclusion, our study has shown that WT1 protein expression level, not MIB-1 staining index, can be used as a prognostic marker to foretell outcome after immunotherapy, and that patients whose tumors have intermediate WT1 expression have the best survival outcome.

The authors investigated the correlation between MGMT silencing in the tumor at recurrence and survival taking into account other clinically recognized prognostic factors. MGMT status was determined by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis, a high-throughput quantitative methylation assay, and immunohistochemistry. In addition, expression analyses of human mutL homolog 1, human mutS homolog 2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 at recurrence were conducted with regard to their prognostic impact.  	The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates after recurrence were 3.6 months and 9.9 months, respectively, and the 6-month PFS rate after recurrence was 27.2%. On multivariate analysis, only age (P=.04) and MGMT promoter hypermethylation at recurrence, as determined by MethyLight technology (P=.0012) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis (P=.004), were correlated with better PFS. On multivariate analysis, only MGMT promoter hypermethylation at recurrence, as determined by using MethyLight technology (P=.019) and MSP analysis (P=.046), was associated with better OS.	MGMT methylation status was an important prognostic factor in patients with recurrent GBM who underwent surgery plus carmustine wafer implantation; therefore, it was useful in predicting the outcome of GBM therapy at recurrence.

Ki-67 counting and hTERT evaluation was assessed on whole tumor sections and on selected areas within each section. Age and length of survival were analyzed in relation to these parameters.	We found that different methods of evaluating the stained sections yielded different results regarding Ki-67, but less marked differences for hTERT. With Ki-67 counting on whole sections (non-selected areas), we found a statistically significant correlation with length of survival. There was no corresponding information in the hTERT assessment. We could also confirm a significant inverse correlation between age and length of survival, as previously published.	Our data demonstrate that different methods of Ki-67 evaluation may give markedly dissimilar results. The significant correlation found between survival and one but not with two other methods of Ki-67 assessment, implicate the value of standardized quantification methods.

Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen surgical specimens obtained from 62 of 73 patients. MGMT promoter methylation was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The prognostic significance of MGMT was evaluated together with other well-known prognostic factors.	MGMT promoter hypermethylation was detected in 35 of 62 patients (56.4%). MGMT immunoreactivity was low in 26 (35.6%) tumors, moderate in 24 (32.9%), and high in 23 (31.5%). Significant correlation was observed between MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation (P < 0.001). Both MGMT promoter methylation and low MGMT expression were independently associated with better progression-free survival but not with longer overall survival. However, in the subgroup analysis, MGMT promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with longer overall survival in patients treated with temozolomide (TMZ) after nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) treatment.	Low MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation are both predictive markers for slower tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma.

Genomic DNA from frozen tissues was extracted by NucleoSpin Tissue (Macherey-Nagel, D√ºren, Germany) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. DNA concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry. DNA (500 ng) obtained from tissue samples, or cell line DNA was chemically modified using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. The modified DNA was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.The methylation status of the genes was determined by the method of methylation-specific PCR (MSP). For basic statistical calculations, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and COX-2 expression were treated as continuous variables. The association of the above parameters with grade, necrosis, and methylation status was tested with Kruskal‚ÄìWallis ANOVA or Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test. The correlations among IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and COX-2 expression and gene methylation status were examined with Spearman correlation coefficient. Survival analysis was performed using death by disease as the endpoint. The effect of various parameters on clinical outcome was assessed by plotting survival curves according to the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier method and comparing groups using the log-rank test, as appropriate.	RARbeta and MGMT genes were more frequently methylated in 70.58% and 58.8% of glioblastomas, respectively. RASSF1A and CDH13 displayed a similar methylation frequency (23.52%) in glioblastomas. No gene methylation was observed in grade II astrocytomas. Tumor grade correlated positively with MGMT and RARbeta methylation (P = 0.005 and P = 0.019, respectively) and the extent of necrosis (P = 0.001 and P = 0.003). Interestingly, the marker of chronic inflammation, IL-6, was positively associated with methylation of MGMT (P = 0.004), RARbeta (P = 0.002), and RASSF1A (P = 0.0081) as well as the total number of methylated genes (P < 0.0001), indicating the important role of IL-6 in maintaining promoter methylation of these genes. VEGF expression correlated positively with MGMT and RARbeta methylation although these relationships were of marginal significance (P = 0.0679 and P = 0.0757). Kaplan-Meier univariate survival analysis indicated an unfavorable survival period in patients with MGMT methylation compared with those without methylation (P = 0.0474). 	Our study highlights the implication of MGMT and RARbeta methylation in the aggressive phenotype of primary glioblastomas. The association of MGMT methylation with clinical outcome indicates its potential prognostic value.

We incorporated circulating biomarker and SNP analyses and pharmacokinetic studies. Nineteen patients were enrolled and the MTD was not reached at the time of study termination. 	Vatalanib was well tolerated with only 2 DLTs (thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases). Other grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and hand-foot syndrome. There were no wound-healing complications. Of the 13 patients evaluable for a radiographic response, 2 had a partial response and 9 had stable disease. Vatalanib significantly increased PlGF and sVEGFR1 in plasma circulation and decreased sVEGFR2 and sTie2. Plasma collagen IV increased significantly by day 50 of treatment.

Limitations of this study include the early discontinuation of the trial prior to achieving the primary endpoint of determining the MTD of vatalanib and lack of MGMT testing performed in patients. Nevertheless, vatalanib was safe and well tolerated up to 500 mg twice daily when combined with radiation and temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Although the study sponsor decided against further development of this particular TKI, the results of this study suggest that targeting VEGFR or other angiogenic receptors with an oral, small molecule TKI is feasible, safe and may improve both progression-free and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

862	Cancer stem cells	CSC	Other	19088037	Tissue	44 GBM	Homo Sapiens	35	77	57							28	16	IV	Pre 2010	Italy	We investigated the relationship between the in vitro growth potential of glioblastoma CSCs and patient death or disease progression in tumors of 44 consecutive glioblastoma patients treated with complete or partial tumorectomy followed by radiotherapy combined with temozolomide treatment. Moreover, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence the prognostic value of the relative presence of CD133+ and CD133+/Ki67+ cells in patient tumors.	In vitro CSC generation and the presence of > or = 2% CD133+ cells in tumor lesions negatively correlated with overall (P = 0.0001 and 0.02, respectively) and progression-free (P = 0.0002 and 0.01, respectively) survival of patients. A very poor overall (P = 0.007) and progression-free (P = 0.001) survival was observed among patients whose tumors contained CD133+ cells expressing Ki67. Taking into account symptom duration, surgery type, age, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation, and p53 status, generation of CSCs and CD133/Ki67 coexpression emerged as highly significant independent prognostic factors, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.37-6.2; P = 0.005) and 4.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-11.9; P = 0.003), respectively.	The analysis of CSCs may predict the survival of glioblastoma patients. In vitro CSC generation and presence of CD133+/Ki67+ cells are two considerable prognostic factors of disease progression and poor clinical outcome.

On the basis of the clinical data for these patients, the association between c-Met expression and clinicobiologic features representing tumor invasiveness was analyzed.	c-Met overexpression was detected in 29.0% (18 of 62) of glioblastomas. In patients with c-Met overexpression, the median survival was 11.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 9.9 months-13.5 months), compared with a median survival of 14.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 months-21.0 months) for patients whose tumors had no or little expression of c-Met (P=.031). On the radiographic analysis, 9 of 18 patients (50%) with tumors overexpressing c-Met demonstrated invasive and multifocal lesions on the initial magnetic resonance images, whereas only 9 of 44 patients (20.5%) with tumors that expressed no or little c-Met demonstrated these features (P=.030). Using immunohistochemistry, we also found a significant association between c-Met expression and matrix metalloproteinase-2,-9 (P=.020 and P=.013). Furthermore, Myc overexpression was found to be closely correlated with c-Met overexpression on IHC analysis (P=.004).	The authors suggest that c-Met overexpression is associated with shorter survival time and poor treatment response in glioblastomas, the mechanism for which is elevated tumor invasiveness on the molecular and clinical phenotypes. This implies that more effective therapeutic strategies targeting c-Met receptors may have important clinical implication.

CD63 expression in tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was examined by double-immunofluorescence with ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). The association between CD63 and TIMP-1 was investigated using previously obtained TIMP-1 data from our astrocytoma cohort. Cellular co-expression of TIMP-1 and CD63 as well as TIMP-1 and the tumor stem cell-related markers CD133 and Sox2 was investigated with immunofluorescence. TIMP-1 and CD63 protein interaction was detected by an oligonucleotide-based proximity ligation assay and verified using co-immunoprecipitation.	The expression of CD63 was widely distributed in astrocytomas with a significantly increased level in glioblastomas. CD63 levels did not significantly correlate with patient survival at a protein level, and CD63 did not augment the prognostic significance of TIMP-1. Up to 38% of the CD63+ cells expressed Iba1; however, Iba1 did not appear to impact the prognostic value of CD63. A significant correlation was found between TIMP-1 and CD63, and the TIMP-1 and CD63 proteins were co-expressed at the cellular level and located in close molecular proximity, suggesting that TIMP-1 and CD63 could be co-players in glioblastomas. Some TIMP-1+ cells expressed CD133 and Sox2.	The present study suggests that CD63 is highly expressed in glioblastomas and that TIMP-1 and CD63 interact.

All tumors expressed PEA-15 in our study. Next, we evaluated prognosis and PEA-15 expression levels in 43 patients with high-grade astrocytomas based on the following parameters: age, gender, WHO grade, surgical resection extent, MIB-1 labeling index (LI), and PEA-15 expression level. Multivariable analyses revealed that high PEA-15 expression level displayed a significant correlation with longer overall survival (OS) in high-grade astrocytomas (P = 0.0024). 	 Twenty-three (35.4%) and 42 (64.6%) tumors expressed low and high PEA-15 levels, respectively. In grade II astrocytoma (diffuse astrocytoma) and grade III astrocytoma (anaplastic astrocytoma), 100% and 88.9% of patients expressed high PEA-15 levels, respectively, while a smaller number (50%) of patients with grade IV astrocytoma (glioblastoma) expressed high PEA-15 levels. PEA-15 expression level was inversely associated with WHO grade (P = 0.0006). Patients with total resection survived significantly longer (P = 0.0044) than those with lower resection extent, while patients with MIB-1 labeling index ‚â§25% indicated significant (P = 0.0434) correlation with OS as well. 	In conclusion, PEA-15 expression level was inversely associated with WHO grade and may serve as an important prognostic factor for high-grade astrocytomas.

All patients were treated by open resection, followed by radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy. The tumors were investigated for MGMT promoter methylation, mRNA and protein expression, as well as presence of MGMT sequence polymorphisms. In addition, we screened for genetic aberrations of the EGFR, TP53, CDK4, MDM2, and PDGFRA genes as well as allelic losses on chromosomal arms 1p, 10q, and 19q. RT-PCR, IHC.	Correlation of molecular findings with clinical data revealed significantly longer time to progression after onset of chemotherapy and longer overall survival of patients with MGMT-hypermethylated tumors. In contrast, MGMT protein expression, MGMT polymorphisms, and aberrations in any of the other genes and chromosomes were not significantly linked to patient outcome. Multivariate analysis identified MGMT promoter hypermethylation and near-complete tumor resection as the most important parameters associated with better prognosis.

By using preoperative imaging, the amount of necrosis was established versus the overall tumor area. The authors also compared preoperative images with postoperative images to define the amount of tumor resected; and they compared molecular markers, proliferation, MVD, and imaging studies with survival among patients who had GBM.	The hypoxia-regulated molecules (HRMs) and indices for MVD and cellular proliferation were associated significantly with tumor grade. Survival was improved when >or=95% of the tumor was resected. Although the total tumor area was associated with overall survival, no differences were observed when the amount of necrosis or a tumor necrosis index (area of necrosis/area of tumor) was compared with survival. The findings indicated that GLUT-1 and VEGF were correlated with survival after controlling for age.

Survival was compared between tumours exhibiting (GBMpos) or lacking (GBMneg) neuronal markers and also between tumours expressing only one vs. two or more neuronal markers.	Forty-five of the 82 tumours (54.8%) including 5 fibrillary, 5 gemistocytic, 30 giant cell and 5 small cell GBMs expressed at least one neuronal marker, synaptophysin being the most frequent (96%). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between GBMpos and GBMneg tumours, all cytologic subtypes combined (P = 0.22). The same was true when cytologic categories were compared. When only GBMpos tumours were analysed, there was a marginally significant difference in outcome between tumours positive for one vs. multiple markers (P = 0.05). This difference was influenced primarily by giant cell GBMs among which the survival time was significantly shorter in the multiple vs. single marker category (median 123 vs. 295 days, P = 0.014). This difference was not observed in the other GBM cell types. Ultrastructurally, rare neurosecretory granules in glial filament-rich cells were identified in one of four tumours studied.

The expression of markers of hypoxia (HIF2Œ±), angiogenesis (VEGF), tumor microvascularity (CD31, CD34, vWF, CD105), and proliferation (Ki-67) were assessed immunohistochemically (IHC). IDH1 mutation and IHC markers were correlated with the patient survival.	20 from 52 GBM tumor samples comprised IDH1 R132H mutation (38.5%). The majority of mutated tumors were classified as secondary glioblastomas (89.9%). Patients with IDH1 mutated tumors experienced better progression-free survival (P = 0.037) as well as overall survival (P = 0.035) compared with wild type tumors. The significantly lower expression of VEGF was observed in GBM with IDH1 mutation than in wild type tumors (P = 0.01). No such association was found for microvascular markers. The increased expression of newly-formed microvessels (ratio CD105/CD31) in tumor samples was associated with worse patient's progression-free survival (P = 0.026).	No increase in HIF/VEGF-mediated angiogenesis was observed in IDH1-mutated GBM compared with IDH1 wild type tumors.

Tregs were not present in normal brain tissue and were very rarely found in low-grade gliomas and oligodendrogliomas. We observed significant differences in the prevalence of Tregs between astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, between tumors of different grades, and between different pathologic types of tumors. We identified Tregs most frequently in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but very rarely in low-grade astrocytomas. The presence of Tregs within GBMs did not alter the median survival in patients from whom the tumors were obtained.	Treg infiltration differed significantly in the tumors according to lineage, pathology, and grade.

74	Six-CpGs panel 		DNA		Tissue	79 GBM	Homo Sapiens	18	999								NA		IV	Post 2010	France	A six-CpG panel was identified by incorporating genome-wide DNA methylation data and clinical information of three distinct discovery sets and was combined using a risk-score model. Different validation sets of GBMs and lower-grade gliomas and different statistical methods were implemented for prognostic evaluation. An integrative analysis of multidimensional TCGA data was performed to molecularly characterize different risk tumors.	The six-CpG risk-score signature robustly predicted overall survival (OS) in all discovery and validation cohorts and in a treatment-independent manner. It also predicted progression-free survival (PFS) in available patients. The multimarker epigenetic signature was demonstrated as an independent prognosticator and had better performance than known molecular indicators such as glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) and proneural subtype. The defined risk subgroups were molecularly distinct; high-risk tumors were biologically more aggressive with concordant activation of proangiogenic signaling at multimolecular levels. Accordingly, we observed better OS benefits of bevacizumab-contained therapy to high-risk patients in independent sets, supporting its implication in guiding usage of antiangiogenic therapy. Finally, the six-CpG signature refined the risk classification based on G-CIMP and MGMT methylation status.	The novel six-CpG signature is a robust and independent prognostic indicator for GBMs and is of promising value to improve personalized management.	Potential		Potential	NA	NA	NA	There have been fewer multi-maker epigenetic biomarkers for GBM prognostication. 	NA	The epigenetic signature also had potential to improve the current risk classification. The six-CpGs signature showed no discriminating value in the small subgroup of GBMs with G-CIMP (about 10%), characterized by mutations in IDH and favorable OS [25], as all G-CIMP+ tumors were low-risk. However, it was useful for identifying patients with different prognoses among the majority of GBMs without GCIMP. The six-CpGs signature also showed great discriminating value in stratified RT/TMZ cohorts with each MGMT methylation status.	The epigenetic panel may have implications in regulating GBM-specific immune response. However limitations still existed in this study. First, the selection of prognostic CpGs was mainly focused on CpGs that were differentially methylated in GBMs, which may result in the exclusion of other probes with high informative value. Second, our six-CpGs signature was more useful to identify a relatively small subset of clinically favorable patients, but showed limited capacity to provide information on the rest block of cases that are in the middle of the clinical spectrum. Third, despite that the six-CpGs signature showed robust prognostic value in G-CIMP- tumors, the model was not developed for that purpose. More powerful prognostic signatures for that tumor subset are still much needed and should be developed with exclusion of G-CIMP+ tumors.

For statistics, the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the consistency between the immunohistochemistry and ELISA data. Patients' survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and curves were compared using the log-rank test. On multivariate analysis, the effect of potential risk factors on the DFS and OS were evaluated using the cox regression proportional hazard models. The threshold for statistical significance was p = 0.05.	We showed that PSA-NCAM was expressed by approximately two thirds of the GBM at variable levels. On univariate analysis, PSA-NCAM content was an adverse prognosis factor for both OS (p = 0.04) and DFS (p = 0.0017). On multivariate analysis, PSA-NCAM expression was an independent negative predictor of OS (p = 0.046) and DFS (p = 0.007). Furthermore, in glioma cell lines, PSA-NCAM level expression was correlated to the one of olig2, a transcription factor required for gliomagenesis.

830	O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase	MGMT	DNA	19884580	Tissue	64 GBM	Homo Sapiens	70	999								NA		IV	Pre 2010	USA	After receiving approval from our institutional review board, we reviewed MGMT methylation status and clinical characteristics of 64 patients ‚â•70 with newly diagnosed GBM who underwent resection at our institution from 1998 to 2009. Patients were included if they had enough tissue for MGMT analysis, so this excluded patients who only had a biopsy (consistent with the prior study in younger patients). MGMT analysis was performed by extracting tumor genomic DNA from fixed, paraffin-embedded sections for bisulfite conversion (EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, Zymo Research, Orange, CA). MGMT methylation-specific PCR was performed using PCR primer sets specific for methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences.6 Kaplan Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to compare median progression free (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) in patients who had methylated (ME) MGMT vs unmethylated (UN) MGMT.	Of the 64 patients identified, 37 (57.8%) had ME MGMT and 27 (42.2%) did not (table). These results were slightly higher than the 44.7% of patients who had ME MGMT and the 55.3% who had UN MGMT in the Hegi et al.1 study but similar to a small study in very elderly patients (‚â•80) where 13/22 patients (59%) had ME MGMT.2 Potential explanations for this small discrepancy include age-related increase in genomic methylation that includes the MGMT promoter or the reduced ability to retrieve usable DNA from archived paraffin-embedded blocks. Initial treatments for patients in our cohort included chemoradiation (35), radiation alone (16), or chemotherapy alone (3). In ME patients, 24/37 patients received an alkylating agent (temozolomide in 23, BCNU in 1) either as first-line therapy (21) or at recurrence (3). Sixteen of the 27 UN patients received an alkylating agent (all temozolomide): 15 as first-line therapy and 1 at recurrence. A total of 10 patients had no or unknown therapy (6 ME, 4 UN). In patients who received an alkylating agent, mOS in ME patients was 489 days vs 263 days in UN patients (p = 0.0021) and mPFS was 405 days vs 246 days (p = 0.2742) (figure e-1 on the Neurology¬Æ Web site at www.neurology.org). In an analysis including all 64 patients, mPFS in ME patients was 328 days vs 173 days in UN patients (p = 0.0241) and mOS was 345 days in ME patients and 223 days in UN patients (p = 0.0178). A univariate Cox proportional hazards model including all 64 patients showed that MGMT methylation was associated with reduced hazard for progression (hazard ratio [HR] 0.427, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.199, 0.914, p = 0.0283) and death (HR 0.475, 95% CI 0.254, 0.890, p = 0.0283). In a multivariate Cox model including age, extent of resection, Karnofsky performance score, and alkylator use, MGMT methylation was significantly associated with a reduced hazard for progression (HR 0.374, 95% CI 0.138, 1.0, p = 0.0521) and death (HR 0.243, 95% CI 0.097, 0.608, p = 0.0025). These results suggest that MGMT methylation is a positive prognostic biomarker in the elderly GBM patient population independent of treatment received.	 Since MGMT methylation was previously thought to be a predictive marker associated with improved response to temozolomide, further work will need to be done to clarify if MGMT methylation is also a predictive marker in elderly patients. We were unable to address this question specifically in our study because of the small number of patients not treated with an alkylating agent.  Tumor tissue markers such as MGMT that may influence prognosis or clinical trial design are just as valid in the elderly population as in younger patients. Although our study was retrospective, it is the largest study of MGMT methylation status in this population. MGMT appears to be a useful prognostic marker in elderly GBM patients and its role in guiding treatment choices as a potential predictive biomarker should be explored in prospective studies.	Yes	NO	YES	YES	YES	NA	O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been firmly established as a biomarker in patients diagnosed with gliomas, for both clinical trials and routine clinical management.	Use in companion diagnostics and predicting patient outcome.	Methylation status of the MGMT gene is crucial to promoting DNA repair. If the MGMT gene is methylated, cancer patients tend to respond better to alkylating drug therapy.	O(6)-Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase determined by promoter hypermethylation is an established GBM biomarker for clinically predicting response to treatment. Key difference in this paper: authors validate use of biomakrer in older patients.	Erik Samelsson

Expression of candidate genes was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.	Five potential markers (CD44 antigen (CD44), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha (GADD45A), fibronectin 1 (FN1), CD63 antigen (CD63) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)) showed expression patterns that correlated significantly with malignant glioma. In particular, expression of the CD44 antigen was elevated in more severe tumor types, and higher in tumor cores than in peripheral regions. However, lower levels of CD44 expression surprisingly correlated with lower survival.	The CD44 antigen is a promising candidate for further development as a prognostic and therapeutic tool.

By bioinformatics analysis, ETBR was found to be upregulated in glioblastoma patients, and its expression levels were correlated with reduced survival. ETBR interacts with key proteins involved in cancer pathogenesis, suggesting it as a druggable target. In vitro viability assays showed that ERAs may hold promise to treat glioblastoma and breast cancer.

In GBM, TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÅ and -Œ≤‚ÇÇ levels were 33- and 11-fold higher respectively than in non-tumoral samples. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses revealed that high to moderate expressions of TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÅ significantly conferred a strikingly poorer OS and PFS in newly diagnosed patients. Interestingly, at relapse, neither isoforms had meaningful impact on clinical evolution. 	We demonstrate that TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÅ is the dominant isoform in newly diagnosed GBM rather than the previously acknowledged TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÇ. We believe our study is the first to unveil a significant relationship between TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÅ expression and OS or PFS in newly diagnosed GBM. TGF-Œ≤‚ÇÅ could serve as a prognostic biomarker or target affecting treatment planning and patient follow-up.

852	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1	TIMP-1	Protein	19430729	Tissue	112 brain tumor (23 diffuse astrocytoma, 17 anaplastic astrocytoma, 72 GBM)	Homo Sapiens										72	51	II;III;IV	Pre 2010	Denmark	 In the present study, the TIMP-1 expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 112 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded astrocytomas and related to tumour grade and overall patient survival by scoring the TIMP-1 immunoreactivity of both tumour cells and blood vessels. Moreover, TIMP-1 in situ hybridisation was performed on ten of the glioblastomas. 	In the vast majority of the tumours TIMP-1 protein was expressed in both tumour cells and blood vessels. In situ hybridisation for TIMP-1 mRNA on glioblastomas confirmed the immunohistochemical expression of TIMP-1. The percentage of TIMP-1 positive tumour cells and blood vessels as well as the staining intensity varied between tumours of the same grade, but the total staining score increased with tumour grade. The multivariate Cox regression test showed that glioblastoma patients with the lowest TIMP-1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (HR (95% CI) = 3.2 (1.5-6.7), P = 0.004) when compared to the patients with higher TIMP-1 protein expression.	In conclusion, this study showed that low TIMP-1 immunohistochemical expression predicts longer overall survival in glioblastoma patients, suggesting a role for TIMP-1 as a biomarker in glioblastoma.

A total of 155 codon 132 mutations were found, of which 131 were Arg132His (88.5%). The IDH1 mutation was inversely correlated with grade, affecting 77% of grade 2, 55% of grade 3, and 6% of grade 4 gliomas (P < 10(-15)). The IDH1 mutation was tightly associated with a 1p19q codeleted genotype (P < 10(-14)) and an MGMT methylated status (P < .001) but mutually exclusive with EGFR amplification (P < 10(-15)) and loss of chromosome 10 (P < 10(-15)). The presence (v absence) of IDH1 mutation was associated with a better outcome in grade 2 (150.9 v 60.1 months, respectively; P = .01), grade 3 (81.1 v 19.4 months, respectively; P < .001), and grade 4 gliomas (27.4 v 14 months, respectively; P < .01). After adjustment for grade, age, MGMT status, genomic profile, and treatment, multivariate analysis confirmed that IDH1 mutation was an independent favorable prognostic marker (hazard ratio = 0.297; 95% CI, 0.157 to 0.564, P = .00021).	This study indicates that IDH1 codon 132 mutation is closely linked to the genomic profile of the tumor and constitutes an important prognostic marker in grade 2 to 4 gliomas.

By univariate analysis with Kaplan-Meier test, we explored the prognostic significance of ZEB1/2 expression and the clinicopathological factors in GBM. By multivariate analysis with the Cox regression model, we identified the independent prognostic factors in GBM.	The percentages of ZEB1 high expression and ZEB2 high expression were 31.9% (29/91) and 41.9% (36/91), respectively. High expression of ZEB2 was significantly associated with lower survival rate of GBM patients (P=0.001). ZEB2, lower KPS score (P=0.004), gross total resection (P<0.001) and higher Ki67 percentage (P=0.001) were notably correlated to worse prognosis of GBM.

Among four glioblastoma subtypes, ANXA2P1 and ANXA2P2 were preferentially expressed in mesenchymal subtype and less expressed in proneural subtype. Meanwhile, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the expression level of ANXA2 was positively correlated with ANXA2 pseudogenes expression. Then, the expression patterns of ANXA2 and its pseudogenes were validated in diffuse glioma specimens (n=99) and non-tumor tissues (n=12) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that highly expressed ANXA2 and annexin A2 pseudogenes were associated with the poor survival outcome of glioma patients. Cox regression analyses suggested that ANXA2, ANXA2P1 and ANXA2P2 were the independent prognosis factors for gliomas. Furthermore, down-regulation of ANXA2 and ANXA2 pseudogenes might contribute to the improvement of patients' survival who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy.	Highly expressed ANXA2 and its pseudogenes were associated with poor survival, and could be the independent prognosis factors for glioma patients.

In parallel, comprehensive integrative genomic analysis of GBM was performed in silico using mRNA microarray and sequencing data. Two whole transcript expression profiling cohorts were used - a set of 3 normal brain tissues and 22 glioma tissue samples and a cohort of 5 normal brain tissues and 49 glioma tissue samples. A validation cohort included 529 GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.	We identified 36 molecules commonly changed at the level of the gene and protein, including up-regulated TGFBI and NES and down-regulated SNCA and HSPA12A. Single amino acid variant analysis identified 200 proteins with high mutation rates in GBM samples. We further identified 14 differentially expressed genes with high-level protein modification, among which NES and TNC showed differential expression at the protein level. 	Moreover, higher expression of NES and TNC mRNAs correlated with shorter overall survival, suggesting that these genes constitute potential biomarkers for GBM.

85	Glycolysis-based ten-gene signature		DNA	29169920	Tissue	NA	Homo Sapiens	NA									NA		II;III;IV	Post 2010	China (TCGA Database, USA)	Herein, based on glioma datasets including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), REMBRANDT (Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) and GSE16011, we established a glycolytic gene expression signature score (GGESS) by incorporating ten glycolytic genes. Then we performed survival analyses and investigated the correlations between GGESS and IDH1 mutation as well as the molecular subtypes in GBMs. 	The results showed that GGESS independently predicted unfavorable prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy of GBM patients. Notably, GGESS was high in GBMs of mesenchymal subtype but low in IDH1-mutant GBMs. Furthermore, we found that the promoter regions of tumor-promoting glycolytic genes were hypermethylated in IDH1-mutant GBMs. Finally, we found that high GGESS also predicted poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy when investigating IDH1-wildtype GBM patients only. 	Collectively, glycolysis represented by GGESS predicts unfavorable clinical outcome of GBM patients and is closely associated with mesenchymal subtype and IDH1 mutation in GBMs.	Potential	NA	Potential	Potential	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	Standard database analysis paper that plots a specific gene panel to patient survivability, IDH-wt status and subtype.

779	Proneural molecular signature		DNA	20838435	Tissue	251 glioma	Homo Sapiens	NA									NA		II;III;IV	Pre 2010	USA	Microarray and clinical data were acquired in un-normalized form from the Rembrandt [9] public data repository (https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/) using data available on November 11, 2009. Clinical data were derived from contributing center institutional diagnoses at Henry Ford Hospital, UCSF, Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, and NCI and are available as Table S1. Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 CEL files were normalized using the robust multi-array average (RMA) method [10] with default parameters from the Matlab Bioinformatics Toolbox. Of the 296 samples downloaded, 176 had associated survival data, 75 were oligodendrogliomas or astrocytomas with grades II or III, and 101 were GBMs. Copy number data was derived using Affymetrix 100K SNP arrays available from the Rembrandt public data repository. Of the 176 samples with survival data, 147 have associated SNP arrays for tumor tissue (85 GBMs, 34 Oligodendrogliomas grades II and III, and 28 Astrocytomas grades II and III). To classify Rembrandt samples within the TCGA classification schema, Rembrandt data for the probes from the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip were mapped to the TCGA class signature genes using HUGO gene symbol and Entrez gene ID number. Differences in gene expression between subtypes were determined using the comparative selection marker module of GenePattern 3.0. Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were used to examine the association between patient survival and four subtypes after adjusting for patient age at diagnosis as well as 1p/19q status whenever applicable. 	We demonstrate that the proneural signature predicts improved clinical outcome among 176 Rembrandt gliomas that includes all histologies and grades, including GBMs (log rank test p = 1.16e-6), but also among 75 grade II and grade III samples (p ‚Ää=‚Ää 2.65e-4). This gene expression signature was enriched in tumors with oligodendroglioma histology and also predicted improved survival in this tumor type (n =‚Ää 43, p ‚Ää=‚Ää 1.25e-4). Thus, expression signatures identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for lower grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and therapy.	 Despite the richness of TCGA GBM data, the absence of lower grade gliomas in this data set prevents analysis genes related to progression and the uncovering of predictive signatures. Integrated DNA and RNA analysis of low-grade and high-grade proneural gliomas identified increased expression and gene amplification of several genes including GLIS3, TGFB2, TNC, AURKA, and VEGFA in proneural GBMs, with corresponding loss of DLL3 and HEY2. Pathway analysis highlights the importance of the Notch and Hedgehog pathways in the proneural subtype. This demonstrates that the expression signatures identified in the TCGA analysis of GBMs also have intrinsic prognostic value for low-grade oligodendrogliomas, and likely represent important differences in tumor biology with implications for treatment and therapy.

Given the marked differences in EMR-3 expression, these data suggest that the variability in EMR-3 transcripts seen in microarrays might represent real differences at the protein expression level in human patients.  	In summary, we provide evidence for the first time that that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor EMR-3 is expressed in some human glioblastomas, and may mediate invasive behavior in these cells. These data serve to identify an interesting potential target for future investigations, and to expand our understanding of EMR-3 function.

A validation study was done to corroborate a subset of the results, including expression levels of miR-196a, -196b, -21, and -15b, by analyzing 92 malignant gliomas by conventional real-time PCR. We modeled the relationship between the expression levels of these miRNAs and the survival rate of 39 glioblastoma patients by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis.	Expression profiles in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas suggested that 16 miRNAs were candidate markers associated with the malignant progression of gliomas. Among them, miR-196a showed the most significant difference (P = 0.0038), with miR-196b also having a high significance (P = 0.0371). Both miRNAs showed increased expression levels in glioblastomas relative to both anaplastic astrocytomas and normal brains in the validation study. Furthermore, patients with high miR-196 expression levels showed significantly poorer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method (P = 0.0073). Multivariate analysis showed that miR-196 expression levels were an independent predictor of overall survival in all 39 glioblastoma patients (P = 0.021; hazard ratio, 2.81).

Survival analyses were done on a uniformly treated, prospective cohort of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (n = 136) by using Cox regression models.	The mean transcript levels of IGFBP-2 and -3 were significantly higher in glioblastomas (GBM) relative to anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), diffuse astrocytoma (DA), and controls whereas IGFBP-5 mRNA was higher in GBM relative to AA and controls (P < 0.05).

Tissue microarrays, however, provide a rapid, inexpensive means of profiling biomarker expression. To evaluate hypoxia markers, tissue cores must show the architectural features of hypoxia; i.e. viable tissue surrounding necrotic regions. Glut-1 may be a useful biomarker to validate tissue microarrays for use in studies of hypoxia-regulated genes in cancer. In this study, we carried out immunohistochemical detection of Glut-1 protein in many tumor and normal tissue types in a range of tissue microarrays.	Glut-1 was frequently found in peri-necrotic regions, occurring in 9/34 lymphomas, 6/12 melanomas, and 5/16 glioblastomas; and in 43/54 lung, 22/84 colon, and 23/60 ovarian tumors. Expression was rare in breast (6/40) and prostate (1/57) tumors, and in normal tissue, was restricted to spleen, tongue, and CNS endothelium.

HNE-immunopositive tumor cells were distributed more diffusely than in perivascular locations (P < 0.05). Pronounced HNE-protein adducts were detected in mitotic, necrotic, and apoptotic cells. HNE was expressed in the endothelium of almost all tumor vessels, but its expression in the walls of the vessels was significantly higher in diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas than in pilocytic astrocytomas and glioblastomas multiforme (P < 0.05).

The same GFs were also studied in 46 specimens of recurrent tumors from the same patients. The positivity and intensity of the immunohistochemical expression were correlated with the tumor grade, the interval and type of recurrence, and the survival.	The expression of all GFs, excepting TGFbeta1, TGFbetaRI and tenascine, was found to be correlated with the tumor grade in all tumors of both astroglial and oligodendroglial origin, whereas ependymomas showed significant differences only for EGFR. Low-grade (Grade II) tumors recurring as anaplastic (Grade III) forms showed GF expression rather similar to initially high-grade gliomas and significantly higher than that of low-grade (Grade II) tumors in both initial surgery and recurrence. Besides, low-grade (Grade II) tumors recurring as low-grade showed significantly longer median recurrence time (5.4 vs. 3.5 years) and better median survival (8.3 vs. 5.4 years) than those recurring as anaplastic forms (WHO III).	The immunohistochemical study of expression of VEGF, EGFR, TGFbeta2, TGFbeta3, PDGF and p53 in all low-grade (Grade II) brain gliomas at the first operation may help to differentiate cases with slower evolution and longer survival from those with higher potential of anaplastic transformation.

An average of 79% of cells in World Health Organization Grade IV (glioblastoma, n = 15) and 57% of cells in World Health Organization Grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma, n = 13) were strongly PROX1 positive; low-grade diffuse astrocytomas (Grade II, n = 13) had 21% of cells that were strongly positive; Grade I tumors (n = 15) had 1.5%; and non-neoplastic brain tissue (n = 15) had 3.7% of cells that were PROX1 positive. Double immunolabeling showed that PROX1+ cells in glioblastomas frequently coexpressed early neuronal proteins MAP2 and betaIII-tubulin but not the mature neuronal marker protein NeuN. Analyses of coexpression with proliferation markers suggest that PROX1+ cells have a marginally lower rate of proliferation than other tumor cells but are still mitotically active.	 We conclude that PROX1 may constitute a useful tool for the diagnosis and grading ofastrocytic gliomas and for distinguishing Grade III and Grade IV tumors from Grade I and Grade II tumors	Potential	Potential	Potential	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA 	Paper showing potential biomarker for Grade stratification.

Moderate to strong intratumoral endothelial cell KIT expression was present in 11 of the 15 tumour types, and was most common in glioblastoma (58%), mixed embryonal carcinoma with teratoma (33%) and renal clear cell carcinoma (29%).	Results of in situ hybridization were in line with those obtained with immunohistochemistry in the cases studied (n = 9). Marked SCF expression was uncommon in tumour endothelial cells, but frequent in perinecrotic tumour cells. Patients with glioblastoma with moderate to strong endothelial cell KIT expression had more favourable survival than those whose tumour showed little or no expression (P = 0.024). Glioblastoma patients whose tumour expressed SCF had an unfavourable outcome compared with those with tumour with weak or no expression (P = 0.034).	Intratumoral microvessels of several types of human malignant tumours express KIT. Tumour cell SCF expression and absence of marked endothelial cell KIT expression are novel adverse prognostic features in glioblastoma.

Concordance in the expression was quantified both calculating the overall agreement and the Cohen's kappa.	We screened 87 human brain tumor biopsies using immunohistochemistry and detected leptin and ObR in 55.2% and 60.9% cases, respectively. In contrast, leptin and ObR were absent in 14 samples of normal brain tissue. The presence of leptin correlated with ObR with overall concordance 80.5%. The leptin/ObR system was highly expressed in glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, while lower expression of both markers was noted in low-grade astrocytomas and gangliogliomas. The association between leptin/ObR and the degree of tumor malignancy was highly significant (P < 0.001). Using double immunofluorescence of glioblastoma tissues, we found co-expression of leptin with ObR and with the proliferation marker Ki-67 in 87% and 64% of cells, respectively. The leptin/ObR-positive tissues also expressed activated forms of STAT3 and Akt. In line with this finding, ObR-positive glioblastoma cells responded to leptin with cell growth and induction of the STAT3 and Akt pathways as well as inactivation of the cell cycle suppressor Rb.	 Statistical analyses were performed using R for Windows software. Cell growth experiments were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance.

Pilocytic astrocytomas were used as controls. 	Q-RT-PCR showed that transcripts of uPA, PAI-1, cathepsin B and MMP9 were significantly more expressed in glioblastomas (n = 52), in comparison to pilocytic astrocytomas (n = 17) (P = 0.049, P < 0.0001, P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively). On both univariate and multivariate analyses, cathepsin B and PAI-1 were strong predictors of overall survival among the group of glioblastomas (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.01, respectively). Immunohistochemical expression of cathepsin B further confirmed its prognostic value in an independent cohort of patients with glioblastoma. In situ hybridization showed that uPA is detected at the invasive edge of glioblastomas, whereas PAI-1 is more abundant in microvascular proliferation and pseudo-palisading cells than at the infiltrative edges. 	These results suggest that cathepsin B and PAI-1 are important biomarkers for the stratification of glioblastoma patients with respect to survival.

A membranous and cytoplasmic immunolabeling for caveolin-1 was detected in neoplastic cells of 60% of cases. No significant differences in terms of caveolin-1 expression were observed between astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. In addition, caveolin-1 expression was not correlated with 1p/19q status in oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligoastrocytomas. Caveolin-1 was expressed in most high-grade (World Health Organization III and IV) gliomas. Low caveolin-1 expression correlated with a higher Ki-67 labeling index and the absence of p53 overexpression in glioblastomas, and it was significantly associated with epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in anaplastic astrocytomas.	In conclusion, the present study indicates that caveolin-1 is not useful as diagnostic marker to differentiate grade II astrocytomas from oligodendrogliomas.

847	Aurora-A kinase;Aurora-B kinase		Protein	19616898	Tissue	40 primary GBM	Homo Sapiens	NA									NA		IV	Pre 2010	Greece	This was a a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of aurora-A and aurora-B expression in 40 patients with primary glioblastomas, and attempted to identify any associations with Ki-67 index and the patients' clinical features. The impact of various treatment modalities and proliferative activity on patient outcome was also assessed. Immunohistochemistry was carried out using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Associations among continuous variables were tested using Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation coefficient, whereas categorical variables were tested by w2 or Fisher‚Äôs exact test as appropriate. The relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable was examined using Kruskal‚ÄìWallis ANOVA test or Mann‚ÄìWhitney U-test as appropriate. Univariate survival analysis was performed using death of disease as the endpoint.	Aurora-A expression was higher in tumors with high Ki-67 expression (p=0.01) and was positively, though marginally, related to aurora-B expression (p=0.085). Aurora-B expression was not linked to Ki-67 expression (p=0.182). Lower aurora-A immunohistochemical expression, chemotherapy administration, and tumor localization in one lobe of the brain implied a greater probability of patient survival in univariate analysis (p=0.044, p=0.008, p=0.041, respectively). Ki-67 and aurora-B immunoreactivities were not associated with patient survival (p=0.918 and p=0.539, respectively).

Rad51 protein expression was then correlated with the actual and predicted survival using recursive partitioning analysis.	Rad51 protein was elevated in 53% of the GBM specimens at surgery. The Rad51 levels correlated directly with survival, with a median survival of 15 months for patients with elevated Rad51 compared with 9 months for patients with low or absent levels of Rad51 (p = .05). At disease recurrence, 70% of patients had additional increases in Rad51 protein. Increased Rad51 levels at disease recurrence similarly predicted for improved overall survival, with a mean survival of 16 months from the second craniotomy compared with only 4 months for patients with low Rad51 levels (p = .13).	Elevated levels of the double-stranded DNA repair protein Rad51 predicted for an increase survival duration in patients with GBM, at both initial tumor presentation and disease recurrence.

The expression levels of miR-10b were associated with higher grade glioma. In addition, mRNA expressions of RhoC and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which were thought to be regulated by miR-10b via HOXD10, were statistically significantly correlated with the expression of miR-10b (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). Also, protein expression levels of RhoC and uPAR were associated with expression levels of miR-10b (p = 0.009, p = 0.014, respectively). Finally, multifocal lesions on enhanced MRI of 7 malignant gliomas were associated with higher expression levels of miR-10b (p = 0.02).

A wild-type IDH1 expression vector construct with a 5‚Ä≤ hemagglutinin (HA) tag was generated by amplifying cDNA synthesized from U251 cells (IDH1 wild type; see below) using primers PC5779 (TAGAATTCCACCATGGCTTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTATGTCCAAAAAAATCAGTGGC) and PC5778 (GTATGAATTCAAAGTTTGGCCTGAGCTAG) and subcloning the PCR product into pTracer-CMV2 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Significance of correlations between the parameters was assessed using either the chi-square test with Yates‚Äôs correction or two-tailed Fisher‚Äôs exact test. The log-rank test was used for univariate analysis, and Cox regression was used for multivariate analysis of potential association between IDH1 mutations and overall patient survival.	Codon 132 mutation was seen in 54% of astrocytomas and 65% of oligodendroglial tumors but in only 6% of glioblastomas (3% of primary and 50% of secondary glioblastomas). There were no mutations in any other type of tumor studied. While mutations in the tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) and total 1p/19q deletions were mutually exclusive, IDH1 mutations were strongly correlated with these genetic abnormalities. All four types of mutant IDH1 proteins showed decreased enzymatic activity	The data indicate that IDH1 mutation combined with either TP53 mutation or total 1p/19q loss is a frequent and early change in the majority of oligodendroglial tumors, diffuse astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, and secondary glioblastomas but not in primary glioblastomas.

Homo Sapiens	NA									NA		I;II;III;IV	Pre 2010	India	We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR and PCNA using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies in 40 cases of astrocytic tumors of which 21 cases were glioblastoma, eight cases were Grade III or anaplastic astrocytomas and six cases were Grade II or diffuse astrocytomas and five cases were Grade I or pilocytic astrocytomas.	Both the EGFR expression and PCNA labeling index increase with increasing grades of astrocytomas with a significantly high percentage of cells showing positive staining for both EGFR and PCNA in GBM and Grade III astrocytomas compared to Grade II astrocytomas. The expression levels of both EGFR and PCNA were low in Grade I or pilocytic astrocytomas.	A significant correlation was found between EGFR overexpression and PCNA labeling index in Grade III and Grade II astrocytomas and glioblastoma. These suggest that the tumor proliferation, at least in higher grades of astrocytomas is dependent in some measure on EGF and EGFR-related signaling pathways.

The anti-J1-31 antibody exhibited strong cytoplasmic staining of reactive gliosis in 17/17 (100%) cases with a higher intensity of staining than that observed in the adjacent normal astrocytes. The antibody showed reactivity with tumor cells in 12/15 (80%) cases of pilocytic astrocytoma, although intensity of staining was generally weaker and more focal than observed in reactive gliosis. J1-31-positive tumor cells were detected in only 9/26 (35%) cases of the low-grade diffuse astrocytoma and none of the cases of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma. Increasing Ki-67 indices paralleled advancing tumor grades. p53 protein was expressed more commonly in infiltrating astrocytomas compared to pilocytic astrocytoma. In conclusion, down-regulation of J1-31 expression correlates with advancing grade of astrocytomas.	The result suggests this protein plays some role in astrocytes that is progressively lost in malignant progression. The anti-J1-31 antibody may help further our understanding of astrocytes in disease and may be useful as an aid in the pathologic diagnosis of astrocytic lesions.

T1 postcontrast and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were used to generate voxel signal intensity histograms that were quantitatively analyzed to determine the extent and intensity of peritumoral signal abnormality as a marker of disseminated disease in the brain.	 CXCR4 expression was markedly elevated in Grade III and IV tumors compared with Grade II gliomas. Significantly, when patients with glioblastoma multiforme were segregated into two groups based on CXCR4 expression level, we observed a statistically significant increase in the intensity and extent of peritumoral magnetic resonance imaging signal abnormalities associated with CXCR4 high-expressing gliomas.	Our data confirm that high-grade gliomas robustly express CXCR4 and demonstrate a correlative relationship between expression levels of the CXCR4 receptor and the magnetic resonance imaging-based finding of a diffuse and more extensive disease process in the brain. CXCR4 expression status may, therefore, prove useful as a marker of disseminated disease in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

Meanwhile, glioma patients lacking hTERT+Œ≤ expression or telomerase activity showed a significant survival benefit. Notably, CX-5461 altered hTERT splicing patterns, leading to an increase of hTERT-Œ≤ transcript and a decrease of hTERT+Œ≤ transcript expression, which inhibits telomerase activity. In addition, CX-5461 had cytotoxic effects on GBM cells and caused telomere DNA damage response, induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis.	The hTERT+Œ≤ is verified to be correlated with clinical parameters in gliomas, and could serve as a prognostic marker or possibly therapeutic target for gliomas.

Patients diagnosed with GBM from 2010 to 2012 who received adjuvant chemoradiation were identified. MGMT promoter methylation status was obtained. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess overall survival (OS) by coding status of MGMT promoter methylation (positive, negative, unknown) and Cox regression analysis was used to assess impact of covariables on OS.	Treatment at academic centers was strongly associated with MGMT promoter status testing (OR 2.23, p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001), as well as hospital facility within the Northeast (OR 1.55, p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001).

The expression level of CapG was found to be associated with several common molecular features of glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV glioma) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. When analyzing the prognosis of GBM patients according to these molecular features, we observed that the prognostic value of CapG was affected by amplification of CDK6 or EGFR. However, overexpression of CapG markedly promoted cell growth in vitro, while depletion of CapG significantly inhibited cell proliferation by blocking the cell cycle in G1/S transition. Moreover, CapG manipulation in glioma cell lines U87 and U251 showed CapG-dependent cellular migration and invasiveness.	 These data suggest that CapG may serve as a prognostic biomarker with potentially important therapeutic implications for glioma.

Subsequently, the prognosis‚Äëassociated DEGs were screened via Cox regression analysis, followed by construction of gene/protein/pathway interaction networks of these DEGs by calculating the correlation coefficient between the DEGs. Next, a prognostic prediction system was constructed using Bayes discriminant analysis, which was validated by the microarray data of samples from patients with good and bad prognosis from the TCGA and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), as well as the GEO dataset. Finally, a co‚Äëexpression network of the signature genes in the prediction system was constructed in combination with the significant pathways. A total of 288 overlapping DEGs (false discovery rate <0.5 and |log2 of fold change|>1) were screened, 123 of which were identified to be associated with the prognosis of GBM patients. The co‚Äëexpression network of these prognosis‚Äëassociated DEGs included 1405 interactions and 112 DEGs, and 6 functional modules were identified in the network. 	The prognostic prediction system was comprised of 63 signature genes with a specificity value of 0.929 and a sensitivity value of 0.948.

72	Galectin-1		Protein	29378529	Tissue	45 GBM	Homo Sapiens						30	50	15	L	27	18	IV	Pre 2010	China	We included 45 patients with GBM who were treated with maximal safe surgical resection or biopsy alone followed by adjuvant RT of EQD2 (equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions)‚Äâ>‚Äâor‚Äâ=‚Äâ60 Gy for homogeneous treatment. Paraffin-embedded tissues acquired from the Department of Pathology were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining for galectin-1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).	Patients with weak expression had a better median survival (27.9 months) than did those with strong expression (10.7 months; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009). We compared characteristics between weak and strong galectin-1 expression, and only the expression level of galectin-3 showed a correlation. The group with weak galectin-1 expression displayed a 3-year OS of 27.3% and a 3-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) of 27.3%; these values were only 5.9% and 7.6%, respectively, in the group with strong galectin-1 expression (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009 and 0.020, respectively). Cox regression was used to confirm that the expression level of galectin-1 (weak vs. strong) is a significant factor of OS (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.020) and CSS (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.022). Other parameters, such as the expression level of galectin-3, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance, gender, surgical method, age‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ50 years, tumor size, or radiation field were not significant factors.	The expression level of galectin-1 affects survival in patients with GBM treated with adjuvant RT. Future studies are required to analyze the effect of other factors, such as O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-promoter methylation status, in patients with weak and strong galectin-1 expression. Ggalectin-1 expression is a poor prognostic factor for patients with GBM treated with adjuvant RT. Studies investigating the targeting of galectin-1 for radioresistance are encouraged in an effort to treat this aggressive brain tumor. The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and limited sample size. According to the national law of human research, informed consent for research should be obtained for work performed in our country after 2002. As we could only include patients before 2002, and the sample size was therefore small. Because these patients were treated a long time ago, almost all were dead, their charts were destroyed, and the time to progression could not be confirmed. Nonetheless, the time to progression and the survival time were correlated in patients who underwent imaging follow-up; not all patients were evaluated for time to progression, yet galectin-1 remained a significant factor of GBM progression after RT. In addition, MGMT promoter methylation is associated with patient response to alkylating agents and OS. Because the proportion of MGMT promoter methylation in the included patients was undetermined, it remains unclear whether galectin-1 expression may affect the importance of the MGMT promoter methylation status for prognosis. Future studies are required to analyze the effect of other factors, such as MGMT methylation promoter status.

A total of 169 patients (99 males [58.6%] and 70 females [41.4%]) were evaluated prospectively. MGMT methylation was evaluable in 140 patients. Among the male patients, 36 were MGMT methylated (25.7%) and 47 were unmethylated (33.6%); among the female patients, 32 were methylated (22.9%) and 25 were unmethylated (17.9%). Survival was longer in the methylated females compared with the methylated males (P = 0.028) but was not significantly different between the unmethylated females and the unmethylated males (P = 0.395).

Study cohort consisted of 93 primary GBM patients treated with radiation-, chemo- and bevacizumab therapy, among which 14 STS (OS‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ12 months) and 6 LTS (OS‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ36 months) were identified, all confirmed being IDH wild-type. RNA expression levels in diagnostic tumor specimen for 792 genes were analyzed by NanoString technology.	While no differences were found with regard to GBM subtype between LTS versus STS, comparative analysis of individual genes identified 14 significantly differently expressed candidate genes. Univariate analysis in the whole patient cohort found that 12 of these were significantly associated with OS, of which increased IFNG, CXCL9, LGALS4, CD34 and decreased MGMT levels remained significant associated with prolonged OS in multivariate analysis correcting for known prognostic variables. Validation analyses in an independent dataset from the AVAglio study confirmed CD34 as significant in comparative analysis between STS and LTS patients and as an independent prognostic factor. Analysis of this dataset further supported CD34 expression to be associated with improved bevacizumab efficacy, while CD34 immunohistochemistry indicated variation in CD34 expression to result primarily from varying tumor vascularization. 	Collectively, CD34 expression candidates as a prognostic biomarker in GBM able to identify survival outliers and could also be predictive for efficacy of bevacizumab.

783	CD133	CD133	Protein	20806346	Tissue	37 GBM	Homo Sapiens			54							17	20	IV	Post 2010	Italy	The authors used immunohistochemistry to assess CD133 expression in 37 paired glioblastoma samples, including 1 primary tumor sample and 1 recurrent tumor sample, after patients received adjuvant radiochemotherapy. To assess the actual composition of the CD133-positive glioblastoma cell population, fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used to sort CD133-positive/CD45-negative cells that were assayed for tumor-specific chromosomal aberrations using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. To rule out endothelial precursor cells, CD133-positive fractions also were assayed with anti-CD34 by FACS.	In recurrent glioblastomas, the percentage of CD133-positive cells was increased by 4.6-fold compared with the percentage in primary glioblastomas, although, in some tumors, it increased up to 10-fold and 20-fold. Unexpectedly, the increase in CD133 expression was associated significantly with longer survival after tumor recurrence. An analysis of tumor-specific chromosomal aberrations and in vivo studies revealed that the CD133-positive cell compartment of recurrent glioblastoma was composed of both cancer stem cells and nontumor neural stem cells. The latter cells represented from 20% to 60% of the CD133-positive cell population, and their relative percentage favorably affected the survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Endothelial CD133-positive/CD34-positive precursors did not contribute to the CD133-positive cell population.	The authors hypothesized that, similar to the phenomenon described in glioblastoma models, neural stem/progenitor cells that are recruited by the tumor from surrounding brain may exert an antitumorigenic effect.

Differences in KI67 positivity among the groups with different E4PHA intensity were evaluated with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U testKruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test.	 Although GBM frequently expressed the bisecting GlcNAc, the lectin reactivity varied among tumor regions within individual specimens.	Since detailed histopathologic analysis revealed that oligosaccharides with bisecting GlcNAc structures were preferably expressed in tumor regions with low KI67 immunopositivity, immunodetection of the bisecting GlcNAc could be useful to indicate less proliferative regions in human GBM. Our study highlights the potential use of lectin histochemistry to develop new methods for diagnosis that would improve future antiglioma therapy.

Patients were treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We considered as end points of the study the overall survival time and progression-free interval. Correlations between HEY1 expression and tumor grade/patient overall survival and free interval before recurrence were analyzed using univariate analysis	Based on the in situ hybridization results, HEY1 expression rate was reported as negative staining in 13 cases (20.6%), as weak staining in 11 cases (17.3%), as moderate staining in 21 cases (33.3%), and as strong staining in 17 cases. We considered in the analysis the cumulative expression of HEY1 at in situ hybridization (Hey Index) as negative in 13 cases and positive in 49 cases (77.78%). The overall survival (P = 0.002) and the free-interval (P = 0.012) were significantly longer in patients who were negative for HEY1 expression.  	Our data suggest that expression of HEY1 might be used as a marker to distinguish glioblastoma patients with a relatively good prognosis from those at high-risk, and that, in the future, HEY1 might represent a therapeutic target.

In patients who received radiotherapy alone following resection, methylation of the MGMT promoter correlated with an improved response to radiotherapy. Unmethylated tumors were twice as likely to progress during radiation treatment. The median time interval between resection and tumor progression of unmethylated tumors was also nearly half that of methylated tumors. Promoter methylation was also found to confer improved overall survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that methylation status was independent of age, Karnofsky performance score, and extent of resection as a predictor of time to progression and overall survival. 	Our data suggest that MGMT promoter methylation appears to be a predictive biomarker of radiation response. Since this biomarker has also been shown to predict response to alkylating agents, perhaps MGMT promoter methylation represents a general, favorable prognostic factor in GBM.

An examination of the genes consistently associated with patient outcome, revealed a consensus 38-gene survival set. Worse outcome was associated with increased expression of genes associated with mesenchymal differentiation and angiogenesis. Application to formalin fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays resulted in a 9-gene subset which appeared robust in these samples. This 9-gene set was then validated in an additional independent sample set. 	Multivariate analysis confirmed that the 9-gene set was an independent predictor of outcome after adjusting for clinical factors and methylation of the methyl-guanine methyltransferase promoter. The 9-gene profile was also positively associated with markers of glioma stem-like cells, including CD133 and nestin.	In sum, a multigene predictor of outcome in glioblastoma was identified which appears applicable to routinely processed FFPE samples. The profile has potential clinical application both for optimization of therapy in GBM and for the identification of novel therapies targeting tumors refractory to standard therapy.

821	O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase protein expression	MGMT	Protein	20150365	Tissue	71 GBM	Homo Sapiens						9	45	62	H	39	32	IV	Pre 2010	Austria	Here, we compared promoter methylation (by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction) and protein expression (by Western blot) in tumor cell explants with respect to prediction of TMZ response and survival of GBM patients (n = 71). 	Methylated MGMT gene promoter sequences were detected in 47 of 71 (66%) cases, whereas 37 of 71 (52%) samples were scored positive for MGMT protein expression. Although overall promoter methylation correlated significantly with protein expression (chi(2) test, P < .001), a small subgroup of samples did not follow this association. In the multivariate Cox regression model, a significant interaction between MGMT protein expression, but not promoter methylation, and TMZ therapy was observed (test for interaction, P = .015). In patients treated with TMZ (n = 42), MGMT protein expression predicted a significantly shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] for death 5.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76-17.37; P = .003), whereas in patients without TMZ therapy (n = 29), no differences in OS were observed (HR for death 1.00, 95% CI 0.45-2.20; P = .99)	These data suggest that lack of MGMT protein expression is superior to promoter methylation as a predictive marker for TMZ response in GBM patients.

We then studied the association between loss of heterozygosity and the expression of p53 protein and Olig2, as analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification, as investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Finally, we assessed the influence of molecular markers on the overall survival of patients. 	We identified five different 1p19q loss of heterozygosity patterns among the tumors studied and found that loss of heterozygosity over the whole 1p arm was associated with loss of heterozygosity over the whole 19q arm in 90% of cases. 1p19q whole loss was present in all the classical oligodendrogliomas, whereas other 1p19q loss patterns predominated in oligoastrocytomas. 1p19q whole loss was also significantly associated with Olig2 overexpression, but was never observed in tumors overexpressing p53 protein. We also found that, among patients with contrast-enhancing tumors, those with 1p19q whole loss tended to survive for longer.	In combination with classical histological and immunohistochemical data, 1p19q status determination provides pertinent information useful for (1) discriminating between histological types of gliomas and (2) identifying a subgroup of tumors that are associated with a better prognosis.

TEM1/endosialin was upregulated in primary and metastatic human brain tumors, where it localized primarily to the tumor vasculature and a subset of tumor stromal cells. Analysis of 275 arrayed grade II-IV astrocytomas demonstrated TEM1/endosialin expression in 79% of tumors. Robust TEM1/endosialin expression occurred in 31% of glioblastomas (grade IV astroctyomas). TEM1/endosialin expression was inversely correlated with patient age. TEM1/endosialin showed limited co-localization with CD31, alphaSMA and fibronectin in clinical specimens.	TEM1/endosialin was induced in the vasculature of high-grade brain tumors where its expression was inversely correlated with patient age. Although lack of TEM1/endosialin did not suppress growth of intracranial GBM xenografts, it did increase tumor vascularity.

The results were validated using western blot and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves and significance determined using log-rank test for selected groups of annexin-1-positive tumors and nuclear staining stratified for WHO grade.	In the normal human brain, the expression of annexin-1 is limited to ependymal cells and subependymal astrocytes, but is also upregulated in reactive astrocytes. Ependymomas and astrocytomas showed significantly higher mean annexin-1 expression levels in the cytoplasm compared with oligodendrogliomas (both: P<0.0001). In addition, nuclear staining of annexin-1 in oligodendroglial tumor cells was significantly reduced (P=0.0002), which may be used as a diagnostic tool for differentiating between astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Although annexin-1 expression in ependymomas decreased with the grade of malignancy, diffuse astrocytomas showed a significant increase in cytoplasmic annexin-1-positive tumor cells. However, survival analysis showed that the expression of annexin-1 is not associated with patient survival. Similar to the EGFR amplification profile, primary glioblastomas had a higher annexin-1 expression level compared with secondary glioblastomas.	Thus, annexin-1 upregulation in astrocytomas may contribute to tumor progression and its expression profile is similar to its substrate, EGFR, suggesting a possible regulation thereof.

The Mann‚ÄìWhitney test was used to compare data acquired in each group for the patient age. The overall survival was defined as the time between the first surgery and death. Survival distributions were estimated by Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis and compared among patient subsets using log‚Äêrank tests.	A total of 39 IDH1 mutations were observed. Mutations of the IDH2 gene, homologous to IDH1, were often detected in gliomas without IDH1 mutations. In the present study, R172 mutation of the IDH2 gene was detected in one anaplastic astrocytoma. IDH1 or IDH2 mutations were frequently in oligodendrogliomas (67%), anaplastic astrocytomas (62%), anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (75%), anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (50%), secondary glioblastomas (67%), gangliogliomas (38%), and anaplastic gangliogliomas (60%). Primary glioblastomas were characterized by a low frequency of mutations (5%) at amino acid position 132 of IDH1. Mutations of the IDH1 or IDH2 genes were significantly associated with improved outcome in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas. Our data suggest that IDH1 or IDH2 mutation plays a role in early tumor progression of several types of glioma and might arise from a common glial precursor.

Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.	IDH1 mutations were detected in 36 of 407 glioblastomas (8.8%). Glioblastoma patients with IDH1 mutations were younger (mean, 47.9 years) than those with EGFR amplification (60.9 years) and were associated with significantly longer survival (mean, 27.1 versus 11.3 months; P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations were frequent in glioblastomas diagnosed as secondary (22 of 30; 73%), but rare in primary glioblastomas (14 of 377; 3.7%: P < 0.0001). IDH1 mutations as genetic marker of secondary glioblastoma corresponded to the respective clinical diagnosis in 95% of cases. Glioblastomas with IDH1 mutation diagnosed as primary had clinical and genetic profiles similar to those of secondary glioblastomas, suggesting that they may have rapidly progressed from a less malignant precursor lesion that escaped clinical diagnosis and were thus misclassified as primary. Conversely, glioblastomas without IDH1 mutations clinically diagnosed as secondary typically developed from anaplastic rather than low-grade gliomas, suggesting that at least some were actually primary glioblastomas, that may have been misclassified, possibly due to histologic sampling error.

Microvessel density was assessed by morphometric analysis. Double immunostaining for Ki 67/CD34 and cleaved caspase-3/CD34 was used to investigate the proliferation and apoptotic fraction of both endothelial and tumor cells. The expression of VEGFs (A-D) was evaluated on immunohistochemistry. To measure tumor vascular stabilization, the ANGPT1/ANGPT2 mRNA balance was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.	Within the hypoxic perinecrotic tumor area, the apoptotic fraction of endothelial cells was positively correlated with VEGFA expression (p < 0.001). Higher levels of VEGFA correlated with greater proliferation of endothelial cells in the intermediate tumor area (p = 0.031). Vascular endothelial growth factor D was significantly more highly expressed within the perinecrotic tumor area compared with the intermediate tumor area (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between the ANGPT1/ANGPT2 balance and the survival time of patients with GBMs (p = 0.035).	The results of the present study suggest that the ANGPT1/ANGPT2 balance has prognostic value in patients with primary GBMs. The authors' findings support the need for further studies of the feasibility of antiangiogenic therapy in primary GBMs, with a special focus on the normalization of tumor vasculature.

Comparisons between two groups were conducted by the Mann-Whitney U-test, while those among three or more groups were conducted by the ANOVA post-hoc test (Scheffe‚Äôs F). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. 	In general, the Olig2-positive nuclei were only sparsely distributed in ependymomas; in contrast, they were very numerous in astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Particularly in cases of glioblastoma or pilocytic astrocytoma that histologically mimicked ependymoma, the Olig2-positive nuclei were numerous as in conventional astrocytomas, which helped to differentiate them from ependymomas. The EMA-positive structures were helpful for the diagnosis of ependymoma, however, they were occasionally very modest and sparse on immunostained sections. A quantitative study showed that the Olig2-positive nuclei were much fewer in ependymomas than in astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. CD99 is a cell surface antigen expressed in some tumors, most notably in Ewing's sarcomas. In our preliminary experiment, we noted the absence of CD99-immunoreactivity in a fraction of brain tumors with clear cell morphology, including oligodendroglioma, clear cell ependymoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma (the oligodendroglioma-like component). Thus, we investigated the expression of CD99 in an additional series of brain tumors with clear cell morphology, including oligoastrocytoma (7 cases), central neurocytoma (6), and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (9). 	These results indicate that the Olig2-immunohistochemistry is useful and potentially more reliable than the EMA-immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis ofependymoma. We found that the absence of CD99-immunoreactivity was dependent on clear cell morphology rather than on tumor entities. The CD99-immunohistochemistry is unique in that it is helpful for the diagnosis of clear cell brain tumors through the visualization of CD99-negative clear cells.
